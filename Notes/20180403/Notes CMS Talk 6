"A systematic approach to assessing and improving the simulation of leading modes of climate variabilty)

Improving our climate models - attempting to deduce model errors from errors in climate statistics has proven difficult

A: model formulation errors
B: cleaate mean bias
C: errors in variability (leading modes of climate variability)
D: Forecast errors (subseasnoal and seasonal)

a affects b, c, d; b and c affect each other; both b and c affect d

looking at tendency errors early on 

dx(t0)/dt = f(x(t0)) + dx(t0)


1) Replay: force a model to track a pre-existing analysis (Takacs et al 2018; Orb et al 2017)
2) Tendency Bias Correction (TBC) Chang et al 2019: 

BASIC Q: TO WHAT EXTENT DOES TBC EHWEN APPLIED GLOBALLY LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MODELS LONG TERM CLIMATE (BIAS/CLIMATE VARIABILITY INCLUDING LEADING MODES OF VARIABILITY/FORECAST SKILL AT S2S)

Two examples: 
a) Leading subseasonal modes during boreal summer

results from geos agcm
b) boreal winter interannual variability and enso

Boreal winter: PNA, NA, AO, etc dominate NH extratropical subseasona var
