MJO: What have we learned from it and where is our field heading
- thermodynamics of the tropics; mjo theory; simulations and diagnostics; response to climate change; 

small variability in space for temperature; large for humidity/rain/convective cells
deep convection -> each convective element warms up the atmosphere through diabatic heating; the heating thickenes the troposheric layer; because the coriolis force near the equator is small, 
gravity waves relax the thickened layer back to its climatological value after a time tg; 
this results in a net balance between upward motion and heating that is known as the "weak temperature gradient approximation"; 

so from each convective cell ther are ripple waves; think of rain on puddle; 
timescales: tg - timescale for gravity waves to relax temperature; tc - timescale for convection to relax humidity; tw - disturbance timescale
non dimentional Nmode=tg**2/(tw*tc); if Nmodel <<1 tg<<tc - moisture dominates (moisture modes); if Nmode>>1 - temperature (Moist Kelvin waves) dominate

a) moisture-dominated regime: 
Long timescales / slow propagation [~Monsoons]
balanced wind field (geostrophic?)
rpecip due to water vapor impact

b) temperature (buoyancy) dominated reegime
short timescales/fast propagation [~days]
unbalanced wind field (acceleration is important)
precip due to CAPE/CIN/Buoyancy (temperature) 

The two regimes are two fundamental modes in the tropics
Paper Adames 2017 - relationship between moisture and precipitation in the tropics; obs show that when MJO is active both moisture and rainfall are high
obs support the notion that MJO is driven by fluctioantions of water vapor

The moisture mode framework:

is not necessarily the "correct" MJO theory but arguably the most scrutinized theory
its predictions: 
- precip anomaly can be diagnosed from moisture
- MJO evoltuoion can be understood via moisture/MSE budget
- MJO initiation is due to moistening of the atmosphere
- MJO simulations can be improved if precip/moisture relation is improved (ie. if convection scheme is properly sensitive to moisture0
 Moisture and MSE budgets indicate that MJO propagation is due to horizontal and vertical moisture advection; 
 primary maintenance mechanism is large scale ascent forced by anomalous long wave radiative heating
 
 Jiang et al 2015L diagnostics show that models for which RH and precip are less similar have the strongest MJO (best MJO when precip most 
 sensitive to RH); Gonzalez and Jiang 2016 - find that models with more humid mean state have stronget MJO; Kim 2017 - similar
 ERA-Interim vs operational ECMWF - MJO in model is weaker and mean state is drier; MSE budget shows weaker advection (there is less moisture to advect);
 
 Shie et al 2018 - mechanism-denial experiments; graogs frequency vs zonal wavenumber; Ways to kill MJO - a) mouisture nudged to climate; b) remove climate LW heating
 (Wheeler kiladis diagram OLR)
 
 cmip3/cmip5 - not so good at MJO (Line et al 2016); current generation - much more robust
 
 Climate change - response to increasing CO2- most studies indicate MJO amplitude willincrease as climate warms; mechanism unclear; also
 (Rushley et al 2019) MJO horizontal scale increases; phase speed tends to increase; why? - because increasing moisture gradients (speed), increasing static stability (slow), decreasing zonal wavenumber (speed), 
 increased convective timescale- ie rain lasts longer (slow); 
 Maloney et al 2019: MJO goes taller as the tropopause deepens; unchanging orvweakening anomalous wind;
 Wolding et al 2017: weakening of global teleconnection signal ; increased static stability leads to weaker upper level divergence which leads to weaker Rossby wave propagation to higher latitudes.
