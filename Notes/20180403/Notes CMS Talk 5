NOAA MAPP S2S Prediction Task Force
s) understand processes underpinning modeling and prediction of s2s phenomena 
-e exploratory research for long term/significant advances (basic/applied research themes) 
- 14 projects -> s2s prediction task force
b) R2O


Figure from NOAA MAPP article "The experts weigh in : how to close the gap between weather and climate predictions"

the atmosphere provides deterministic (weather) skill for 1 week; remote ocean  dominate at long term >= month
land may be the key to middle

can be interpreted as saying that a purely statistical model with MJO and QBO can have predictive skill ~30 days out
