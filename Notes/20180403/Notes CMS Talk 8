ENSO, NAO, etc: 
= which modes are most predictable on s2s
relationship between them

Study by Xiang et al 2019; target: DJF NH weeks 1-7 surface air temperature, 2003-2013 hindcasts

three most predictable modes: ENSO mode; NAO mode; Eurasian Mode; skill to week 5;
colors: surface air temperature shading, 500hp heigth contours

- skill not strongly tied to MJO
Eurasian and NAO mode skill related to initial stratospheric polar vortex strength

exploring identification of windows of opportunity: composites of high/low skill OLR IC pattern

--
- Predictability from distinct flavors of ENSO
- Role of atmospheric and land initial conditions (dry california during 2015/2016 ENSO is erroneously forecast as wet unless atm and land IC are included)

Initial conditions from stratosphere are extremely important for high latitude MAM skill T2m over Eurasia

Arctic oscillation patern second key to predictability (after ENSO) - but to get it correctly you need the correct stratospheric IC 

Scaife and Smith (2018) = NAO skill increases with ensemble size: substantail winter prediction skill of NAO index for long leads even beyond 1 year in Met office Predictions


SUmmary: 
- subseasonal prediction - identified predictable modes of variabilty and their contributions to skillful weeks 3-5 temperature forecasts
- subseasonal prediction: demonstrated potential for identifying windows of opportunity for skillful prediction of teleconnection patterns and their impacts
- seasonal prediction; identified sourcse of skill independent of the canonical ENSO influence (ENSO flavors, Land/Atmosphere ICs at short leads, stratosphere) and demonstrated their utility in practical prediction problems
